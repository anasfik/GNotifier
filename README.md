# Usage
Happy that I see that you want to try it :)

first, clone this project into your machine with : 
```
git clone https://github.com/anasfik/GNotifier.git
```

then open it with your code editor and run : 
```
flutter pub get
```

since like I've say there's no data collected, it doesn't interact with any network database, so don't worry about more configurations

tools used:
Framework: flutter
State management: Getx
local Database: Hive DB


and here you go !
